A collection of find exercism problems, solved by me.  
These problems were solved on exercism's rust track, found here:  
https://exercism.io/tracks/rust

I did not write the boilerplate code, test code, or function skeletons,
only the function implementations found in the src/lib.rs files.

# Building and Running the Tests
Type  

    cargo build

followed by  

    cargo test

to run the tests on the written code.
